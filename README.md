I am a self-motivated and detail-oriented developer with a strong foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in creating web applications and games. Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my knowledge in software design, focusing on both functional and scalable solutions. 

Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with UI/UX designs, and working on projects that challenge me to grow as a developer.
